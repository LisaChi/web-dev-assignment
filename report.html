        <h1>My Experience</h1>
        <p>At the beginning of this process, I had no clue how hard the task would be. In all honesty, I thought I would
            complete the website in a day however the first obstacle that I faced was finding a vision of what I wanted
            my website to look like. I found out the hard way that you can not put words on the screen and expect it to
            all fall into place it was about actively thinking about the next move I made. I would create a page and
            would constantly go back and revisit it trying to constantly improve my work. I was in a competition with
            myself on how to make the perfect website and came to the realisation that it reflects me, an imperfect
            beautiful mess. I was about to watch my vision grow before my very eyes and in the end, it broke me only to
            build me up again in my image (you know like how you break your code only to build a stronger website). This
            module has caused me to think outside the box and truly explore the wonders of my mind and create what you
            see today my imperfect beautiful mess that is perfect in my eyes.</p>
        <section class="ups">
            <h1>My Ups</h1>
            <p>My greatest accomplishment on my website is my background, I spent hours working on the animation and
                getting the colour scheme to coincide with my favourite colour aqua. It filled me with a great sense of
                fulfilment when I was able to figure out the solution on my own and boosted my confidence towards
                finishing this assignment. Another great accomplishment of mine is the navigation transition on the
                mobile view. I had struggled to make the navigation slide into frame and when I finally discovered how
                to do it my morale was boosted to new heights and again gave me the confidence boost that I needed to
                push on further.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="downs">
            <h1>My Downs</h1>
            <p>One of my hardest challenges was adding the mobile navigation transition to the mobile page. I was stuck
                trying to get the transition to appear in frame since I had inverted mine from the exercises (the
                hamburger icon is on the right instead of the left). The background colour was not appearing, the
                navigation was going over the hamburger icon and the text was coming from the wrong direction. I kept on
                breaking my code and scouring the internet and YouTube for a solution. Once I found my answer, I was
                overjoyed that my code was working and that all my efforts went towards a functioning code. Another
                difficult part of my website was linking my portfolio page to my CSS pages. A small oversight on my part
                lead to hours of contemplating a functioning code and the issue being my miss-spelling of the word
                portfolio (I missed out the letter f), that was a really hard day for me to come to the fact that one
                letter could almost defeat me and from then on I utilised the autofill feature in Visual Studio. Another
                challenge that I ran into was adding the hover effect over the images on the portfolio page, but like
                the typo in the word portfolio, I was not going to let that defeat me either. I tested and broke my code
                many times to be left with the precious gem you see today which is now one of my favourite pages on my
                website (second only to the page about yours truly of course). Even though it made me want to give up I
                persevered and have a page that I am proud of to show.</p>

                <h1>Look back through the time</h1>
                <h3>Friday 8th March 2022</h3>
                <p>I had just begun this page with only having "hello world". Unsure about what to do or what creative
                    style I should go in.</p>

                <h3>Monday 11th May 2022</h3>
                <p>Put my head down and created the colour scheme and background. I chose the colour aqua because that
                    was similar to the hair colour I had at the start of the project. I think a nice accent colour to go
                    with aqua is white but I want something more unique than just those plain solid colours.</p>

                <p>Made the website fully functional with transitions and animations. It took me a couple more days
                    after finding a background animation I liked to actually work but after that, I was able to use my
                    lessons from creating that background into adding more animations on my other pages such as the
                    fade-in between each page and the word bounce on my homepage.</p>
